<h1>Buying a Railcard</h1>
<h2>Why does this need a separate page</h2>

<p>I was contacted by <a href='https://twitter.com/puckipedia'>@puckipedia</a> regarding the 16-25 railcard website asking for gender. I took a look and found this rabbit hole goes a bit deeper than I expected, with different railcards having slightly different forms, despite looking like just rebrands of the same website. In all cases, gender and title cannot be modified on the website, and <strong>you must phone the railcard company to get title or gender changed</strong> (as I did a number of years ago for my 16-25 railcard). Note that digital railcards do not include title.</p>

<p>I emailed National Railcards on 15th February 2019 to request a justification for requiring a binary gender on three of their railcards (16-25, 26-30 and Senior). Following a few email delays and some discussion, as of 28th March 2019, I'm pleased to confirm that National Railcards no longer require gender from any of their railcards! Thank you to the Data Protection Team at Rail Delivery Group for discussing it with me and making the change.</p>
  
<p>So, here's the list:</p>

<p>I contacted Railcards for an explanation, and they were apologetic about the situation and passed on my comments "for future consideration". I will be monitoring the railcard websites periodically to see if they make any changes regarding this and will report any changes on here.</p>
