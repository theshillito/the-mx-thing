<h1>Banks</h1>
<h2>and some other financial stuffs</h2>
<h3>Halifax</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Product:</strong> Current account with debit card</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> Existing customer</li>
    <li><strong>Method:</strong> Face-to-face (Crewe branch) </li>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> 9th July 2016 </li>
    <li><strong>Response:</strong> Will not allow Mx on account or cards. </li>
    <li><strong>Result:</strong> I closed my account. </li>
  </ul>
<h3>Natwest</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Product:</strong> Current account with debit card</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> Existing customer</li>
    <li><strong>Method:</strong> Face-to-face (Knutsford branch) </li>
    <li><strong>Result:</strong> Mx title applied to account and debit card. </li>
    <li><strong>Note from Peter:</strong> When this was done, their main system for doing changes would not let the staff member change the title to Mx. However, the staff member went into some console/DOS looking screens and manually typed in Mx in numerous screens (it took a while, but they were very keen to do it everywhere). Unfortunately, there was one place they missed (paper statements) but I told the Crewe branch and they fixed this straight away.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Product:</strong> Credit card</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> Existing customer</li>
    <li><strong>Method:</strong> Phone call </li>
    <li><strong>Result:</strong> Mx title applied to credit card. </li>
    <li><strong>Note from Peter:</strong> Communications (postal/email) use just "M" as a title, despite card saying "MX".</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Yorkshire Building Society</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Contributed By:</strong> h0m54r</li>
    <li><strong>Product:</strong> Mortgage</li>
    <li><strong>Report:</strong> When I applied for a mortgage with YBS, the paperwork I saw listed Mx as a selectable option along with the more traditional titles. Don’t know if that applies to their other products.</li>
  </ul>
    <h3>Post Office Money</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Product:</strong> "Matched" Credit Card</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> Requires a mandatory and gendered title, but what is printed on the card is entirely custom, so you can change the title on the card or remove it entirely (mine says "MX").</li>
  </ul>
