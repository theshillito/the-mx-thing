<h1>The Mx Thing</h1>
<h2>Who lets you be non-binary</h2>
<p>Here's the website where I write down my experiences trying to maintain a non-binary identity as a <strong>UK resident</strong>. If I start getting contributions from other countries, this website will get more useful and I can drop this caveat (so please contribute if you can).</p>
<p><strong>Another caveat:</strong> I am interpreting "prefer not to say" as a non-binary option in both gender and title fields. This might not make you happy, but it's enough for me; ditto fields being optional.</p>
<p><strong>A cravat:</strong> A frilly necktie.</p>
